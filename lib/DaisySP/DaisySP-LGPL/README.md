## üßê DaisySP and Contribution

This is not a standalone library, and requires [DaisySP](https://www.github.com/electro-smith/DaisySP) to work properly.

Any contributions to this library are welcome under the same guidelines as DaisySP.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è License

DaisySP-LGPL uses the LGPL-2.1 license.

For the full license, read the [LICENSE](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisySP-LGPL/blob/master/LICENSE) file in the root directory.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Distribution
If you distribute code that makes use of DaisySP-LGPL, you are obligated to give end users the option to recompile with the LGPL components having been replaced.

To make this easier, we have provided a script called [gather_lgpl.sh](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisySP-LGPL/tree/master/distribution/gather_lgpl.sh) which can gather the required files with a simple build system for that purpose.

1. From your project directory run `<DAISYSP-LGPL_DIR>/distribution/gather_lgpl.sh <PROJECT_NAME>`
2. Use the `-l` and `-d` flags to override the default libDaisy and DaisySP locations.
3. A standalone `distribution` folder will be created containing:
    - A Readme
    - The LICENSE file(s)
    - A standalone Makefile
    - And any relevant build files under a `resources` folder.
4. End users with the `distribution` folder can relink from source with their own modified copy of `libdaisy-lgpl.a` by replacing that file in the `resources` folder, and running `make`.
